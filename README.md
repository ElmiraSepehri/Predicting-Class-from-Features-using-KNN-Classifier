# Predicting-Class-from-Features-using-KNN-Classifier
# I will practice using the kNN (k-Nearest Neighbors) algorithm to solve a classification problem.
The kNN is a simple and robust classifier, which is used in different applications.



I will use the Iris dataset for this project.
The dataset was first introduced by statistician R. Fisher and consists of 50 observations from each of three species Iris (_Iris setosa_, _Iris virginica_ and _Iris versicolor_). For each sample, 4 features are given: the sepal length and width, and the petal length and width.



The goal is to train kNN algorithm to distinguish the species from one another.
